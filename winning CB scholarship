Prateek Bhaiya decided to give 100% scholarships to the needy students by taking an admission test. However in order to avoid any losses at the institute, he came up with a solution. Coding Blocks has N students and M discount coupons. A student will get 100% waiver if he gets X discount coupons.
However in order to get more discount coupons in addition to those M , Bhaiya decided that some students who perform badly in the admission tests, need to pay additional amount equivalent to Y discount coupons, i.e. good students earn discount coupons and weak students need to pay coupons to get admission.
Find out the maximum number of students who can get 100% waiver in their admission fees.
Note : Bhaiya will try his best to give 100% discount to maximum students possible.
